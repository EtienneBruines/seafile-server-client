# seafile-server-client

## Is this for me?
* [ ] You have a Seafile server, and some other servers posing as clients (i.e. syncing static websites). 
* [ ] Optional: You might be running servers with ARM-architecture, thus being unable to use the official Seafile client. 
* [ ] You won't be editing the files on those servers (read-only). 

## Requirements / dependencies
* It's being developed with the latest Go version (currently 1.6), but should work with (nearly) all other versions as well. 
* No other dependencies needed, and should compile for nearly any architecture Go compiles to.
